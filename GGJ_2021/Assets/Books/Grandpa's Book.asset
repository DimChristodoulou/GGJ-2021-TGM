  - To my beloved grandson. Do not open before January 31 2021.
  - I know how much you love astronomy. Remember that meteorite we used to talk about?
    The one that passes every 2000 years.
  - Well, after years of observing and calculating, I found out that it will pass
    by on 31/01/2021. I placed the coordinates around the town, but you'll have to
    take a closer look.
  - Also, you'll have to find out the passcode to open the observatory doors.
